## What need does HYPER satisfy?

If you follow any stock market, most likely you also had at least once the thought to yourself: **why on Earth didn't I invest back when it was a fraction of today's share**?  It can be painful, but we do it over and over again.
It takes a lot of time and energy to always research and be up to date regarding high potential stocks. At other times, one's too careful with stocks riskier than usual and end up not investing at all.

HYPER's services cater to both problems.
1. Trend analysis shows which topics are worth getting into, and which are on the downside.
2. HyperTrade carries out automated trading with the monthly amount you choose. No more stressing or researching.

## How does HYPER work?

The underlying principle behind HYPER:
It scrapes social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter and TikTok, and feeds data into an NLP pre-trained BERT model. Thanks to its bidirectional characteristic and the datasets it pre-trained on, BERT is one of the most sophisticated models out there currently. The identified keywords’ frequencies are stored and analyzed based on a historical approach, therefore the model can determine the diretion the trend is moving and can select the stage a certain topic falls into. The 5 stages are: High potential/Around its peak/Dangerous territories/Rebouncing in process/Steady growth.

Each datapoint on the graph represents a topic, which has a summary view containing a short description, possible risks, social media coverage and relevant stocks to follow.

There is also the possibility of HyperTrade, which acts as an automatized trading service, which can make trades within the budget of the chosen monthly amounts. For people without the time or expertise to make high risk-high reward investments, HyperTrade offers a stress-free and simple alternative to having an early entry in high potential stocks.

The prototype was developed in React and the live demo can be found at (use Chrome for full functionality): https://hyper-trade-app.web.app

## The team

We are two friends with a few sleepless nights in hackathons behind our backs.
Marton Elődi is an experienced Product Developer, while Peter Lakatos is a Data Scientist. Both completed their MSc in the EIT Digital Double-degree program.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
